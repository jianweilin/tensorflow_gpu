A script to install tensorflow with gpu.

Prerequisites:-
Make sure you have installed all of the below:-
           
     ->  Nvidia Current Drivers  (Try to install stable version instead of latest.)
              => You can verify your installation by typing the following in terminal
                         $ sudo nvidia-smi
                         This should have outputed a table which specifies your version.
              => If you don't have Nvidia drivers. You can install it using the below commands
                         $ sudo apt-get purge nvidia*    
                         The above line will remove all previous installed drivers (brokens drivers too)
                         $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers
                         $ sudo apt-get update
                         $ sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
                         $ reboot
                         Now execute the below command & check if it outputs the drivers
                         $ nvidia-smi
                         $ sudo apt-mark hold nvidia-current
                         The above comman will prevent future updates, therefore your driver will be stable
												 All is done.
												 
		 ->  python3
		 ->  pip
